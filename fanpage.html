        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Opeth is a progressive metal band hailing from Stockholm Sweden. Formed in 1989, the band experienced many lineup changes within it's first few years, with the band's founding frontman David Isberg leaving in 1991. The only remaining member from the band's founding year, Mikael Åkerfeldt, took over vocals, and within the next 30 years has asserted himself as not only the human face of the band, but a world reknown creative force in the industry from their first studio album in 1995 to their most recent release in 2019</p>
